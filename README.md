 OOP Game Show App

Object-oriented programming (aka OOP) has been applied to this project to develop the "Phrase Hunter" game. This is summarized by the three JavaScript files; "app.js", "Game.js" and "Phrase.js". The application selects one of the stored phrases by random in which the player will attempt to guess the phrase by using the onscreen keyboard or their own keyboard.

 For the "exceed expectations" grade, the user interface has been rendered differently (from heading texts to background colors). The more prominent changes are as follows:
 - Title has been changed from "Phrase Hunter" to "Movie Hunter".
 - When the user fails to clear the game, they are prompted with a message to watch the movie or they can retry. The text content of the button has changed to "Retry".
 - If the user is able to guess the movie they are allowed to play the game again by clicking the "Click here" button.
 
 All the edits to the above mentioned part can be found in the fourth JavaScript file,"styling.js". Worth mentioning is that the function "styleInterface()" in "styling.js" is being called when the application reveals the "game over" message. For more reference, please check the "gameOver()" method in the "Game" class (row 94 and row 100 in "Game.js").
